# Employee Expense App

Employee Expense Recording Application

I created a cross-platform app in Xamarin to record employees’ expenses such as food or petrol receipts. This involved both backend and front-end development to successful create an app that meets strict requirements.

Programming languages used – Xamarin, C# and SQL
